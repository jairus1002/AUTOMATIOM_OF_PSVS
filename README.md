About RoboKem
RoboKem is an annual robotics competition that focuses on developing autonomous robots capable of playing the game of Kem. Kem is a strategic board game that requires players to plan their moves, anticipate their opponent's actions, and make strategic decisions to achieve victory.

The RoboKem Competitions provide a platform for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to showcase their robotic systems, algorithms, and AI techniques. Participants are encouraged to design and implement intelligent agents capable of playing Kem effectively, with the ultimate goal of developing robots that can outperform human players.
